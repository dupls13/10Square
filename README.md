# 10Square
App for tracking progress

Used in ABA therapy as a replacement for a token board
App consists of 10 squares that, when pressed, displays an "X"

*Bug
-Buttons may need to be pressed twice in order to display/hide X 
-Boolean would be considered over all buttons rather than individual

**Fixed bug
-Button display now changed on single button press
